              <p>Your body involves all aspects of your physical self. It includes your diet, your sleep, your exercise and 
                  how you treat your body in general. What do you do to maintain it in good shape. Do you live a sedentary 
                  lifestyle or are you always on the go? Do you have a good diet or do you overindulge on fastfood? It all 
                  has a bearing on your health. Could you do more to help your body? Our body Section will give you a brief 
                  introduction to ways you can start to make better lifestyle choices.

              <p>Your mind is a powerful tool, when it works well you can achieve almost anything, but it can also be detrimental 
                  to our wellbeing. Do you overthink about every little aspect of your life. Is stress beating you down and does 
                  it make everything so much worse. Or maybe you push yourself to the limit, and beyond your physical and mental 
                  capability. Could you do more to help your mind? Our Mind Section will provide you with ways to quiten down and use your mind more affectively.</p>

              <h2 class="specific-styling">Spirit</h2>
              <p>Not so obvious but just as important. A healthy spirit/soul can help you experience the joy in life. Do you feel worn down 
                 by life and stuck in a rut. Do you have a purpose or do you feel devoid of emotions. This 
                 can affect how you interact with others and can make it hard to feel positive when life gets you down. Could you be doing 
                 more to help your spirit along. Our Spirit Section will explore ways you can get in touch with yourself and build your 
                 relationship with the world around you.</p>
