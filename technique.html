                        major role. Diet is important, keep to a well balanced diet, curb snacking and ensure 
                        you intake key nutrients.  Exercise can be a great way to keep in shape, and can suit

                    get through any crisis. If you need help, reach out to others, its important to maintain 
                    good communication and foster good relationships as these  will be people that will support 
                    you in troubled times.
