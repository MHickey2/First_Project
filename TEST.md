<summary>Validator Testing</summary>

- W3C Validator 

Using [https://validator.w3.org/](https://validator.w3.org/) I tested each page individually and fixed any errors indicated. In the Index page I had used too many arias for features and I removed them. Initially my testing for the 
lifestyle page would not work, so I figured it was the embedded video that was causing the problem so I commented it out
and tested and there were no other problems. The next page had some issues with the links in the resource section but fixed them and there were also some issues with missing tags that highligted one issue that was masking the real one, the body tag had been entered at wrong place and caused rolling issues near bottom of page but fixed that. Other than some headings missing the rest of the site tested without problems. There is some indepth discussion on issues in the bug session.

  ### Contrast Checker
  Using [https://color.a11y.com/](https://color.a11y.com/) I checked the site for any contrast issues and there were some issues with my introductory text and buttons on my information panels on the index page, so I used the colour contrast checker to test new colours that would not cause any issues, I then made the changes in my css files and tested again, and on revision all the pages passed their tests.
