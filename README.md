## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
Tha Balancing pact Website is targeted at the general population from hard working students, people with
busy lifestyles and parents in need of some downtime. It provides information on how you can incorporate
a few simple life changes to improve the quality of your life. It is a concise and practical compendium 
of useful tips and resources to hopefully give inspiration and practical advice for people seeking out 
ways to improve their health and wellbeing. Users will also be able to sign up for an upcoming Webinar 
on the subject and will have the option to use social media to join a community of like minded people.  
<br/>

## UX Strategy <a name="uxstrategy"></a>
The website is designed as an introduction to the subject of 'Life Balance', so the aim is to present 
information in a condensed and logical manner within 3 main subject areas. This involved intensive research
initially to find what subject areas are most pertinent and how they can be presented to the users. There was also
a period of competitor analysis on existing websites to evaluate the goals I needed to concentrate on within the project. It was also important to identify the target audience for the website to determine the tone needed in the delivery of the
site.
<br/> 

### The Business Goals of the website: <a name="businessgoals"></a>
- no commercial goals, but the site is to build awareness of ways a person can improve their quality of live by adopting simple changes that can integrate into their lives and improve their quality of life.
- Provide simple tips on achieving good work life balance.
- Promote engagement with users by giving them access to a regular newsletter.
- Further engage the user by allowing users to register for an upcoming webinar that offers an interative and more indepth insight into the issues within the site. 
- Offer users the opportunity to engage with others by joining with dedicated social media in order to build a community of people who have the goal to attain more balance in their lives. 
  <br/> 


### The Target Customer: <a name="targetcustomer"></a>
The audience of the site is fairly diverse, but the site would generally be aimed at an adult audience, all genders and age groups. 
Open to single people and those in families, with or without childeren.
Working people, unemployed, Student or retired.
Would probably have some access to digital technology.
People who are seeking some advice or tips on maintaining balance in their lives or can be prone to stress in their lives.

## Colour Scheme    <a name="colourscheme"></a>  

The colour scheme for the website has evolved over time and mainly consists of these complementary colours. There are other colours in the site but they are all a derivation of these colours. 
<br/>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/colourscheme.png"/>
</p>
<br/>

### Other Colours

- Home Page: 
- The Cover Text on Hero Image: 
- Welcome Panel: Gradient
- Next Page:
- Resources Section background:
- Sign Up Form:


## Fonts used on Site  <a name="fonts"></a>

### Roboto 
font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;    
font-weight: Light 400;  
font-weight: Bold 700;

Used for the majority of the site, both for regular text and headings. Sans serif is the fallback font in case other font is not available. See below for example of font in use.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/font.png"/>
</p>

### Dancing Script  
font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;  
Font-weight: Regular 400;  
Font-weight: Bold 700;

Used for the opening Welcome Text in the welcome section on the home page and for the Quotes linked to the body, mind and
spirit section on the lifestyle page, and the error message on the 404.page. Cursive is the fallback font in case other font is not available. See below for the font in use.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/quote.png"/>
</p>
<br/>



## Icons used on site<a name="icons"></a>

<br/>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/fonticons.png"/>
</p>
- In relation to the Logo I used a 'Balancing Scales icon' to support the overall message of balance in the website.<br/>
- I added the Social Media Icons to the footer element to represent each Social Media Channel.<br/>
- In ther resources section, for logistic reasons I could not add the name of the website in the links themselves so used the arrow icon to indicate what each links relate to as a temporary measure. I also used up arrow in the top of Screen button found at the bottom of each website pages (404 page is short and did not require this feature).        
<br/>
<br/>



## Website Structure <a name="structure"></a>    


The website has 4 pages<br/>
- Home Page - Introduces to the subject of Life Balance and introduces the subject areas. It contains links to the Lifestyle Page.<br/>
- Lifestyle Page - Content (Images, Text, Lists and Quotes) is grouped into 3 sections (Body, Mind and Spirit).<br/>
- Next Page - Content broken down into 4 sections (Closing Text and image, Resources and form Section containing details and a registration Form)<br/>
- Confirmation Page - Content (Image and Text and information Panels) displayed to User when they register for the Webinar. User not currently being redirected as the form is sending information to the Code Institute.<br/>
<br/>
There is an additional customised 404 Page - These page is shown when the page required is not available to the user. It consists of an Image and an error message.

 ## Features  <a name="features"></a>
There are some common featurses available on each page of the website. 

The Logo is positioned at the top left corner and it also acts as a link back to the home page, wherever you are on the site. When a user scans your page, they are naturally drawn to the left hand side and it is a prominent convention in web design to follow this logic. 

The Navigation bar is positioned at the top right of the webpag on Desktop and middle screens, but is responsive and is redeployed where screen size gets smaller. 

<br/>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/header.png" height="47" width="673"/>
</p>
<br/>
Each page also has a footer which contains Social Media links, these open to individual Social Media Pages, but as these are dummie links they are not linked to specific accounts. There is also a copyright address contained within this section.   

<br/>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/footer.png" height="67" width="673"/>
</p>
<br/>

#### User Experience related to common elements on each page

### Logo
- The Logo is in the same place on each page.
- The logo can be pressed by the user and they will be returned to the home page.

### Navigation
- There is a navigation bar with clear links to all website pages.
- Navigation tabs are located at the top of the screen which is familiar to the users as it is a common design convention.
- There is an obvious change when the user hovers over the menu items.
- When a menu item has been chosen there is a clear indication that a page has been selected, and the user knows what page they are on.

### Footer
- Social network links are clearly displayed in the footer.  
<br/>


## The Home Page <a name="homepage"></a>
<br/>

### Hero Image/Overlay:  
The Home Page's first imapact is the Hero Image at the top of the screen below the header section. This image hopes to capture a delicate balancing act, and is symbolic for the delicate balance we maintain in our lives despite the ongoing effects of a sometimes busy and hectic lifestyle. The colour scheme being green is conducive to health and healing when you research the impact of colour on emotional wellbeing. This image will be rendered smaller on a smaller screen. In combination with the image there is an overly with the key message of the site, and acts as an introduction and an invitation to learn more.   
<br/>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/hero.png" height="249" width="636"/>
</p>
<br/>

### Sign Up for Newsletter*: 
This section is displayed early to get the user's attention early. This is the user's opportunity to interact with the site and build a relationship with the site moving forward. This feature has since been removed and will hope to have a better grasp of javascript in order to use a pop up window to find the user details and another pop up to confirm that they have signed up for the newsletter. Image shows how it did look on the screen before the removal.  
<br/>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/newsletter.png" height="32" width="511"/>
</p>
<br/>

### Welcome Section: 
This section builds on from the work in the Hero Image/Overlay, by providing more information to the user, this provides the context for the site, and should give the user enough inofrmation to gauge whether this site has anything to offer them and what they can expect from the site. The text is supplemented by the image, which helps the user relate to the human element behind the website. 
<br/>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/welcome.png" height="244" width="665"/>
</p>
<br/> 

### Breakdown of Information areas: 
The site is boken down into 3 main areas and this section gives a simplified explanation of what they are, what they encompass and there is a call to action ie Body Tips, if they want to go to that area of particular interest i.e Body, Mind and Spirit. There are images to support the textual information.
<br/>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/boxes.png" height="277" width="590"/>
</p>
<br/>   

### The Footer: 
This area shares the Social Media Links with the user, and carries some copyright information for the site.  On a fully developed site it may also include a sitemap, navigation etc. There would also be contact information and a location for the given company/person.
<br/>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/footer.png" height="67" width="673"/>
</p>
<br/>

### What's Next Section: 
The Section includes an image, helping the user relate to the site content and there is a text area, recapping what has been covered so far in the site and highlighting the resources available in the next section and promoting the upcoming webinar which will concentrate on the topics included in the website.

</p>
<br/>    

### The Resources Section: 
The Section includes a table with details of websites that will help the user learn more about the subject areas. There is a name, a brief description of the site and links that will bring user directlly to the sites. (will open on to new site in new window, so as to allow the user to keep present site open.  
<br/>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/resources.png" height="190" width="607"/>
</p>
<br/>  

### The Form Section: 
This section includes a text box explaining the details of the upcoming Webinar, the date, time and location and a Form where the user can register for the Webinar. The post links, use the Code Institute link, as the Webinar is not an actual Event but has been created for educational purposes.
The form itself contains required fields before you can submit the form. There is also a minimul limit on how many characters are needed to complete the name fields. In this case '4 characters' are needed in the name fields.  I would have used placeholders but trusted users would understand what is required.  The email field requires the '@' in order to be a valid entry. There is a placeholder in this field, giving them the format that is required of them. There is also a reset button included to allow user to clear their entries, if they need to restart the process.
I had tried to add javascript event listener to the submit button, but this prooved problematic as it was redirecting the user before all fields were entered and felt it was more advantageous to have the form working correctly, but this again would be an area I would revisit in order to have the Form fully functionally with the redirection in place. I did leave the javascript in place and have comments explaining  the issue. 
<br/>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/formsection.png" height="303" width="674"/>

  <br/>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/form.png" height="434" width="435"/>
</p>
<br/>    


## The Confirmation Page <a name="confirmation"></a>

It gives them a compact information panel with time and date details with an image showing the date of the Webinar in pictorial form. It also displays a pictorial representation of the Zoom logo, and a message that the link will be delivered to them via email.
There is also a final message to the user on  why it is a good idea to connect with social media as there will be additional information and resources available within these channels. This also acts as a CTA to engage in these channels.  
 <br/>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/thanks.png" height="238" width="377"/>
</p>
<br/> 

#### User Experience Checklist for Confirmation Page

- The layout focuses the user's attention on the essential details needed for the webinar I.e. The date and time and the location.

-There is a clear call to action as the user is encouraged to connect on social media channels to avail of further information and resources.  


## The 404 Page  <a name="404"></a>
This page is displayed to the user if they experience a problem connecting with a desired link. In accordance with the general theme of the site, it conveys a serene image, with an accompanying message in the spirit of relaxation.  I believe the image conveys the spirit of relaxation and although not normally done I left the usual Header and footer elements of the website in place in order for the user to return to the website on whatever page they require. The steps I took to add the 404 page can be found [here](#404). The 404 Page can be found at [https://mhickey2.github.io/First_Project/error.page](https://mhickey2.github.io/First_Project/error.page)
<br/>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/errormessage.png" height="244" width="357"/>

<br/> 

#### User Experience Checklist for 404 Page

- The image is in keeping with the concept of the website.
- All page content (image and message) is useful and appropriate for the situation.

## Features to be implemented in the Future <a name="future"></a>
- As mentioned previously, there were a couple of challenges with existing features that I would like to improve in the future. I will utilize javascript to redirect users to the thank you page after they submit their details for the webinar. 
- I will also insert the call to action for the newsletter sign up, and use javascript to create a pop-up form and a notification when they have sucessfully signed up.
- In relation to forms I would also use a captcha/anti-spam feature for security reasons.
- At the moment the navigation on small screens seems adequate, but if I was to add more menu items I would have to implement a hamburger menu.
- I would like to introduce more interactivity in the site by use of a blog, with the latest blog being highlighted within the site and enable users to comment and form threads to promote connections.

### Content of the site
I created the written content but drew inspiration from this:
[Better up.com Blog](https://www.betterup.com/blog/mind-body-and-soul?fbclid=IwAR3YrY5lJSkBwhZ5ThmwbzLNSRhWmvyO2dHpYe2XXrltwZ-tI8QgQrWUlWo)
I have had an interest in holistic health and stress management in the past and feel Work/Life Balance is a topic highly relevant in the current climate.  
I used the documentation and template provided by the Code Institute to provide the structure of the README file and referred to the GitHub documention as the basis of my Deployment section.

### Media
All the imagery from the site was obtained from:<br/>
Pixalbay Pexels, Unsplash<br/>
The video was sourced from YouTube.<br/>

### Code
The Social Media and Navigation code were based on the code in 'Cool Runnings' project, the previous website on the Code Institute Course.

### Sources
