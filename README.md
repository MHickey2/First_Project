## UX Strategy <a name="uxstrategy"></a>
The website is designed as an introduction to the subject of 'Life Balance', so the aim is to present 
information in a condensed and logical manner within 3 main subject areas. This involved intensive research
initially to find what subject areas are most pertinent and establish suitable ways this information can be presented to the users. There was also a period of competitive analysis on existing websites to evaluate the goals I needed to accomplish within the project. It was also important to identify the target audience for the website to determine the tone needed in the delivery of the site's content.
<br/> 

### The Business Goals of the website: <a name="businessgoals"></a>
- No commercial goals, but the site's goal is to build awareness of ways a person can improve their quality of live by adopting simple changes.
- Provide simple tips on achieving good work life balance.
- Promote engagement with users by giving them access to a regular newsletter.*
- Further engage the user by allowing the to register for an upcoming webinar that offers an interative and more indepth insight into the issues within the site. 
- Offer users the opportunity to engage with others by joining with dedicated social media channels in order to build a community of people who have similar goals. 
  <br/> 


### The Target Customer: <a name="targetcustomer"></a>
- The audience of the site is fairly diverse, but the site would generally be aimed at an adult audience, all genders and age groups. 
- Open to single people and those in families, with or without childeren.
- Working people, unemployed, Student or retired.
- Would probably have some access to digital technology.
- People who are seeking some advice or tips on maintaining balance in their lives or can be prone to stress.

## Colour Scheme    <a name="colourscheme"></a>  

The colour scheme for the website has evolved over time and mainly consists of these complementary colours. There are other colours in the site but they are all a derivation of these colours. 
<br/>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/colourscheme.png"/>
</p>
<br/>

### Other Colours




## Fonts used on Site  <a name="fonts"></a>

### Roboto 
font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;    
font-weight: Light 400;  
font-weight: Bold 700;

Used for the majority of the site, both for regular text and headings. Sans serif is the fallback font in case other font is not available. See below for example of font in use.  

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/font.png"/>
</p>

### Dancing Script  
font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;  
Font-weight: Regular 400;  
Font-weight: Bold 700;

Used for the opening Welcome Text in the welcome section on the home page and for the Quotes linked to the body, mind and
spirit section on the lifestyle page, and the error message on the 404.page. Cursive is the fallback font in case other font is not available. See below for the font in use.  

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/quote.png"/>
</p>
<br/>
In relation to the color, I gave the main font the color #313131t can aid in preventing eye strain and can be used in a multitude of situations.  

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/textfont.png"/>
</p>
<br/>

## Icons used on site<a name="icons"></a>

<br/>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/fonticons.png"/>
</p>
- In relation to the Logo I used a 'Balancing Scales icon' to support the overall message of balance in the website.<br/>
- I added the Social Media Icons to the footer element to represent each Social Media Channel.<br/>
- In ther resources section, for logistic reasons I could not add the name of the website in the links themselves so used the arrow icon to indicate what each links relate to as a temporary measure. I also used up arrow in the top of Screen button found at the bottom of each website pages (404 page is short and did not require this feature).        
<br/>
<br/>



## Website Structure <a name="structure"></a>    


The website has 4 pages<br/>
- Home Page - Introduces to the subject of Life Balance and introduces the subject areas. It contains links to the Lifestyle Page.<br/>
- Lifestyle Page - Content (Images, Text, Lists and Quotes) is grouped into 3 sections (Body, Mind and Spirit).<br/>
- Next Page - Content broken down into 4 sections (Closing Text and image, Resources and form Section containing details and a registration Form)<br/>
- Confirmation Page - Content (Image and Text and information Panels) displayed to User when they register for the Webinar. User not currently being redirected as the form is sending information to the Code Institute.<br/>
<br/>
There is an additional customised 404 Page - These page is shown when the page required is not available to the user. It consists of an Image and an error message. 

The Home Page Information panels on the bottom of the page have internal links to sections on the Lifestyle page, this allows the users to be taken directly to an area of interest i.e Body, Mind or Spirit Section.

There is an inclusion of the top of the screen button at the bottom of each screen which will allow the user to return to the top of the screen, this is a handy feature particularly with pages with a lot of content and when on mobile screens.


 #### [Return to Table of Contents](#toc)
----
 ## Features  <a name="features"></a>
There are some common features available on each page of the website. 

The Logo is positioned at the top left corner and it also acts as a link back to the home page, wherever you are on the site. When a user scans your page, they are naturally drawn to the left hand side and it is a prominent convention in web design to follow this logic. 

The Navigation bar is positioned at the top right of the webpage on Desktop and middle screens, but is responsive and it is under the Logo when screen size gets smaller. 

<br/>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/header.png" height="47" width="673"/>
</p>
<br/>
Each page also has a footer which contains Social Media links, these open to individual Social Media Pages, but as these are dummie links they are not linked to specific accounts. There is also a copyright address contained within this section.   

<br/>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/footer.png" height="67" width="673"/>
</p>
<br/>

#### User Experience related to common elements on each page

### Logo
- The Logo is in the same place on each page.
- The logo can be pressed by the user and they will be returned to the home page.

### Navigation
- There is a navigation bar with clear links to all website pages.
- Navigation tabs are located at the top of the screen which is familiar to the users as it is a common design convention.
- There is an obvious change when the user hovers over the menu items.
- When a menu item has been chosen there is a clear indication that a page has been selected, and the user knows what page they are on.

### Footer
- Social network links are clearly displayed in the footer.  
<br/>


## The Home Page <a name="homepage"></a>
<br/>

### Hero Image/Overlay:  
The Home Page's first imapact is the Hero Image at the top of the screen below the header section. This image conveys a delicate balancing act, and is symbolic for the delicate balance we maintain in our lives despite the ongoing effects of a sometimes busy and hectic lifestyle. The colour scheme being green is conducive to health and healing when you research the impact of colour on emotional wellbeing. This image will be rendered smaller on a smaller screen. In combination with the image there is an overlay with the key message of the site, and acts as an introduction and an invitation to learn more.   
<br/>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/hero.png" height="249" width="636"/>
</p>
<br/>

### Sign Up for Newsletter*: 
This section is displayed early to get the user's attention early. This is the user's opportunity to interact with the site and build a relationship with the site moving forward. This feature has since been removed and I hope to have a better grasp of javascript in order to use a pop up window to find the user details and another pop up to confirm that they have signed up for the newsletter. The below Image shows how it did look on the screen before the removal.  
<br/>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/newsletter.png" height="32" width="511"/>
</p>
<br/>

### Welcome Section: 
This section builds on from the work in the Hero Image/Overlay, by providing more information to the user, this provides the context for the site, and should give the user enough information to gauge whether this site has anything to offer them and what they can expect. The text is supplemented by the image, this visual helps the user relate to the human element behind the website. See image below.
<br/>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/welcome.png" height="244" width="665"/>
</p>
<br/> 

### Breakdown of Information areas: 
The site is broken down into 3 main areas and this section gives a simplified explanation of what they are, what they encompass and there is a CTA ie Body Tips, if they want to go to that section on the Lifestyle Page they need to click this button. The images support the textual information. See image below.
<br/>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/boxes.png" height="277" width="590"/>
</p>
<br/>   

### The Footer: 
This area shares the Social Media Links with the user, and carries some copyright information for the site.  On a fully developed site it may also include a sitemap, navigation etc. There would also be contact information and a location for the given company/person. THis site has been built for educational purposes and there is no existing location. See image below.
<br/>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/footer.png" height="67" width="673"/>
</p>
<br/>


#### User Experience Checklist for Home Page

- The page has text and images that support the overall theme of the site.
- The Hero Image including the cover text conveys the underlying message of the site.
- There is an obvious starting point on the page.
- Home page is clearly recognised as the home page with inclusion of welcoming text below the Hero Image.
- Related information is grouped together under specific headings in the information section below the welcoming text.

## The Lifestyle Page (formerly Technique Page) <a name="lifestyle"></a>

### The Body Section: 
This section contains a text box containing information related to improving your physical health. There is an image supplementing this information and there is a list included that gives simple tips on how you can be pro-active in improving your own physical health. In addition there is a body related quote, to support the overall message, this also helps balance the symmetry of the section, as it threw off the general aesthethic of the site. See image below.
<br/>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/body.png" height="426" width=683"/>
</p>
<br/> 

### The Mind Section: 
This section contains a text box containing information related to improving your mental health. There is an image supplementing this information and there is a list included that gives simple tips on how you can be pro-active in improving your own mental health. In addition there is a mind related quote, to support the overall message, this also helps balance the symmetry of the section. See image below. 
<br/>
<p align="center">

In addition there is a quote, to support the overall message of the importance of working on the body, mind and spirit to emphasise the importance of combining the elements, this also helps balance the symmetry of the section. See image below.
<br/>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/spirit.png" height="416" width="683"/>
</p>
<br/>  

#### User Experience Checklist for Lifestyle Page  

- The Images and Video are relevant to the subject matter.
- Video does not start automatically.
- Related information is grouped together.
- Page is not cluttered and there is plenty of white space.
- The background is simple and does not distract the user from the content.
- Content can be scanned easily with short paragraphs, lists and images.
- Sub-headings are short and descriptive.



## The Next Page <a name="next"></a>

### What's Next Section: 
The Section includes an image, helping the user relate to the site content and there is a text area, recapping what has been covered so far in the site and highlighting the resources available in the next section and promoting the upcoming webinar which will concentrate on the topics included in the website. See image below.
<br/>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/nextsection.png" height="441" width="616"/>
</p>
<br/>    

### The Resources Section: 
The Section includes a table with details of websites that will help the user learn more about the different subject areas. There is a name, a brief description of the site and links that will bring user directly to the relevant sites.(will open on to new site in new window, so as to allow the user to keep present site open). See image below.  
<br/>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/resources.png" height="190" width="607"/>
</p>
<br/>  

### The Form Section: 
This section includes a text box explaining the details of the upcoming Webinar, the date, time and location and a Form where the user can register for the Webinar. The post links, use the Code Institute link, as the Webinar is not an actual Event but has been created for educational purposes.
The form itself contains required fields before you can submit the form. There is also a minimal limit on how many characters are needed to complete the name fields. In this case '4 characters' are needed in the name fields.  I would have used placeholders but trusted users would understand what is required.  The email field requires the '@' in order to be a valid entry. There is a placeholder in this field, giving them the format that is required of them. There is also a reset button included to allow users to clear their entries, if they need to restart the process.
I had tried to add javascript event listener to the submit button, but this prooved problematic as it was redirecting the user before all fields were entered and I felt it was more advantageous to have the form working correctly, but this again would be an area I would revisit in order to have the Form fully functionally with the redirection to the Confirmation Page in place. I did leave the javascript in place and have comments explaining  the issue. See image below. 
<br/>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/formsection.png" height="303" width="674"/>
</p>
<br/>    

#### User Experience Checklist for Next Page

- Related information in grouped together i.e Resources Section, Webinar Section.
- Colour is used to group and structure items on the page i.e Resources and Webinar section.
- There are no broken links.
- Page content is in language the user will understand.
- Links to Resouce sites are indicated by arrows, ideally I would have name in link itself, but this prooved problematic so had to compromise to ensure mobile screens could see the information more clearly.
    
### Form:
- Only necessary questions are on the form.
- Fields are labelled conventionally.
- Form submission is confirmed by a confirmation page, in this case the Code Institute page showing that the information has been inputted to the site, but in future a confirmation page will be implemented.
- The user is given direction on what is needed to fill in the form correctly I.e required fields, no of characters, inclusion of '@'.
- Email field contains an example to make the expected input clear.
  <br/>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/form.png" height="434" width="435"/>
</p>
<br/>    


## The Confirmation Page <a name="confirmation"></a>
This page should be displayed when the user registers for the webinar, it confirms to the user that they have their place confirmed in the webinar. There is also a verbal CTA on why it is a good idea to connect with social media as there will be additional information and resources available within these channels. The Page also provides the user with a set of compact information panels with time and date details with an image showing the date of the Webinar in pictorial form. It also displays a pictorial representation of the Zoom logo, and a message that the link will be delivered to them via email.
 
 <br/>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/thanks.png" height="238" width="377"/>
</p>
<br/> 

#### User Experience Checklist for Confirmation Page

- The layout focuses the user's attention on the essential details needed for the webinar i.e. The date and time and the location.
- The images reinforce the details in the information panels. Making use of skeuomorphism by using objects i.e. Zoom Logo and Scheduling Icons, concepts easily recognized by users. 
-The background is uncomplicated so necessary information is easily found.
-The user is informed on what the next steps will be in relation to the webinar.
-There is a clear call to action as the user is encouraged to connect on social media channels to avail of further information and resources.  


## The 404 Page  <a name="404"></a>
This page is displayed to the user if they experience a problem connecting with a desired link. In accordance with the general theme of the site, it conveys a serene image, with an accompanying message in the spirit of relaxation.  I believe the image conveys the spirit of relaxation and although not normally done I left the usual Header and footer elements of the website in place in order for the user to return to the website on whatever page they require. The steps I took to add the 404 page can be found [here](#404). The 404 Page can be found at [here](404.html)). See image below.

<br/>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/errormessage.png" height="244" width="357"/>
</p>
<br/> 

#### User Experience Checklist for 404 Page

- The image is in keeping with the concept of the website.
- All page content (image and message) is useful and appropriate for the situation.

## Features to be implemented in the Future <a name="future"></a>
- As mentioned previously, there were a couple of challenges with existing features that I would like to improve in the future. I will utilize javascript to redirect users to the Confirmation Page after they submit their details for the webinar. 
- I will also insert the call to action for the newsletter sign up, and use javascript to create a pop-up form and a notification when they have sucessfully signed up.
- In relation to forms I would also use a captcha/anti-spam feature for security reasons.
- At the moment the navigation on small screens seems adequate, but if I was to add more menu items or just improve legibility I would have to implement a hamburger menu. (for now I changed the header to a darker shade to ensure the menu items stand out more).
- I would like to introduce more interactivity in the site by adding a blog, with the latest blog being highlighted within the site and enable users to comment and form threads to share ideas on related topics. 
- I have considered adding jpg images for older iPhone screens but believe that there is support for safari screens from Apple 14 onwards, so will continue to research best practise. 
- I would probably increase the number of resources in the Resources section.

## Bugs and Issues <a name="bugs"></a>

### Home Page  
- Initially I had a problem with the navigation, in that I could not change the spacing between the menu items, and when I tried different display types, it caused issues when making the navigation responsive, in the end I stripped it right back and simplified the format using the Love running Navigation as a template for the present Nav.

- The cover text had a tendancy to drift, but worked with sizing and padding to allow the cover text to fit within the hero image on all size screens.
  
- I had a problem with the welcome section of the home page with aligning the image in the smaller screens, but in the end I hid the image in smaller screens as I felt the image wasnt adding much and didn't want the home page to have excess content.

- The boxes section was problematic as I had set the boxes at a minimal height and when the page was on a small screen there was too much spaces between the buttons and the content, but modified the code and it's working alright now.  

### Lifestyle Page
- I had some problems with alignment in each section, but managed to use sizing to enable different elements fell into position when being responsive.
  
- The Spirit Section, in particular was problematic as the section tended to overlap the footer element, it still does this a little during transiitions between mid-level breakpoints but believe this is a minor but unavoidable issue.

- The video I used was originally longer, so swapped it for a shorter duration one, as I felt this might improve loading time, there is an issue when using any third party resource, I have used prefetch in the header, but can't attest to any improvement in loading time, but the video is loading and will play when selected.      

### Next Page  
- I had some issues with the Resource section, originally I had 3 fields, with the last one being links, ideally using links is not adequate and the preferred format would be identifying where the user will be sent to, but there was not enough space, I then used arrows to point to the links in the next field and was not happy with this, so my Mentor suggested having the link in previous field which is what I ended up doing and was a good compromise as there is a description inside the field with the link itself. This also allows the table to be seen more clearly.

- Alignment caused a problem within the Form section, but eventually I managed to figure out how the form and webinar information panel could fit within the section with no issues.      

### Confirmation Page  
- I had some problems with the information boxes on this page, but used the layout of the information boxes on the first page as a template and managed to improve the layout issues.    

### 404 Page
- I had some issues with background in the image for smaller screens, but used a smaller alternative, specifically for the smaller screens and this fixed the issue.  

### Unfixed Issues  
- Lighhouse testing has flagged a number of issues with render-blocking resources and third party resouces affecting performance, also some cacheing issues, and I am not sure how to deal with these yet.
- I did begin to add png/jpg versions of images so that older iPhones will be able to show images, but had issues doing this with all images in the site, so would like to research more into whether this would be necessary now that safari has begun to support WebP images since 2020.

### Content of the site
I created the written content but drew inspiration from this:
[Better up.com Blog](https://www.betterup.com/blog/mind-body-and-soul?fbclid=IwAR3YrY5lJSkBwhZ5ThmwbzLNSRhWmvyO2dHpYe2XXrltwZ-tI8QgQrWUlWo)
I have had an interest in holistic health and stress management in the past and feel Work/Life Balance is a topic highly relevant in the current climate.  
I used the documentation and template provided by the Code Institute to provide the structure of the README file and referred to the GitHub documention as the basis of my Deployment section.

### Media
All the imagery from the site was obtained from:<br/>

The video was sourced from YouTube.<br/>

### Code
The Social Media and Navigation code were based on the code in 'Cool Runnings' project, the previous website on the Code Institute Course.
