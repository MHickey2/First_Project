 ## Features  <a name="features"></a>
There are some common featurses available on each page of the website. The Logo is positioned at the top left corner and it also acts as a link back to the home page, wherever you are on the site. When a user scans your page, they are naturally drawn to the left hand side and it is a prominent convention in web design to follow this logic. The Navigation bar is positioned at the top right of the webpag on Desktop and middle screens, but is responsive and is redeployed where screen size gets smaller. Each page also has a footer which contains Social Media links, these open to individual Social Media Pages, but as these are dummie links they are not linked to specific accounts. There is also a copyright address contained within this section.   

#### User Experience related to common elements on each page

### Logo
- The Logo is in the same place on each page.
-The logo can be pressed by the user and they will be returned to the home page.

### Navigation
- There is a navigation bar with clear links to all website pages.
- Navigation tabs are located at the top of the screen which is familiar to the users as it is a common design convention.
- There is an obvious change when the user hovers over the menu items.
- When a menu item has been chosen there is a clear indication that a page has been selected, and the user knows what page they are on.

### Footer
- Social network links are clearly displayed in the footer.  


## The Home Page <a name="homepage"></a>
### Hero Image/Overlay:  
The Home Page's first imapact is the Hero Image at the top of the screen below the header section. This image hopes to capture a delicate balancing act, and is symbolic for the delicate balance we maintain in our lives despite the ongoing effects of a sometimes busy and hectic lifestyle. The colour scheme being green is conducive to health and healing when you research the impact of colour on emotional wellbeing. This image will be rendered smaller on a smaller screen. In combination with the image there is an overly with the key message of the site, and acts as an introduction and an invitation to learn more.   

### Sign Up for Newsletter*: 
This section is displayed early to get the user's attention early. This is the user's opportunity to interact with the site and build a relationship with the site moving forward. This feature has since been removed and will hope to have a better grasp of javascript in order to use a pop up window to find the user details and another pop up to confirm that they have signed up for the newsletter. Image shows how it did look on the screen before the removal.  

### Welcome Section: 
This section builds on from the work in the Hero Image/Overlay, by providing more information to the user, this provides the context for the site, and should give the user enough inofrmation to gauge whether this site has anything to offer them and what they can expect from the site. The text is supplemented by the image, which helps the user relate to the human element behind the website.  

### Breakdown of Information areas: 
The site is boken down into 3 main areas and this section gives a simplified explanation of what they are, what they encompass and there is a call to action ie Body Tips, if they want to go to that area of particular interest i.e Body, Mind and Spirit. There are images to support the textual information.  

### The Footer: 
This area shares the Social Media Links with the user, and carries some copyright information for the site.  On a fully developed site it may also include a sitemap, navigation etc. There would also be contact information and a location for the given company/person.  

#### User Experience Checklist for Home Page

- The page creates text and images that support the overall theme of the site.
- Images are meaningful and support the text on the page.
- The Hero Image including the cover text conveys the underlying message of the site.
- There is an obvious starting point on the page.
- Home page is clearly recognised as the home page with inclusion of welcoming text below the Hero Image.
- Related information is grouped together under specific headings in the information section below the welcoming text.
- Clickable items are clearly distinguished.
- The information is concise and there are no large areas of text.
- Content is easily scanable with short paragraphs and there is a clear hierarchy on the page with headings and subheadings indicating what is related to each section.  

## The Lifestyle Page (formerly Technique Page) <a name="lifestyle"></a>

### The Body Section: 
This section contains a text box on the information related to improving your physical health. There is an image supplementing this information and there is a list included that gives simple tips on how you can be proactive in improving your own physical health. In addition there is a body related quote, to support the overall message, this also helps balance the symmetry of the section, as it threw off the general aesthethic of the site.  

### The Mind Section: 
This section contains a text box on the information related to improving your mental health. There is an image supplementing this information and there is a list included that gives simple tips on how you can be proactive in improving your own mental health. In addition there is a mind related quote, to support the overall message, this also helps balance the symmetry of the section.  


### The Spirit Section: 
This section contains a text box on the information related to improving your spiritual health. There is a list included that gives simple tips on how you can be proactive in improving your own spiritual health. There is also an embedded Iframe with a simple 5minute meditation sourced from YouTube, which will allow the user's to try a mediitation for themselves. In addition there is a quote, to support the overall message of the importance of working on the body, mind and spirit to emphasise the importance of combining the elements, this also helps balance the symmetry of the section.  

#### User Experience Checklist for Lifestyle Page


## The Next Page <a name="next"></a>

### What's Next Section: 
The Section includes an image, helping the user relate to the site content and there is a text area, recapping what has been covered so far in the site and highlighting the resources available in the next section and promoting the upcoming webinar which will concentrate on the topics included in the website.  

### The Resources Section: 
The Section includes a table with details of websites that will help the user learn more about the subject areas. There is a name, a brief description of the site and links that will bring user directlly to the sites. (will open on to new site in new window, so as to allow the user to keep present site open.  

### The Form Section: 
This section includes a text box explaining the details of the upcoming Webinar, the date, time and location and a Form where the user can register for the Webinar. The post links, use the Code Institute link, as the Webinar is not an actual Event but has been created for educational purposes.
The form itself contains required fields before you can submit the form. There is also a minimul limit on how many characters are needed to complete the name fields. In this case '4 characters' are needed in the name fields.  I would have used placeholders but trusted users would understand what is required.  The email field requires the '@' in order to be a valid entry. There is a placeholder in this field, giving them the format that is required of them. There is also a reset button included to allow user to clear their entries, if they need to restart the process.
I had tried to add javascript event listener to the submit button, but this prooved problematic as it was redirecting the user before all fields were entered and felt it was more advantageous to have the form working correctly, but this again would be an area I would revisit in order to have the Form fully functionally with the redirection in place. I did leave the javascript in place and have comments explaining  the issue.   

#### User Experience Checklist for Next Page

- Related information in grouped together i.e Resources Section, Webinar Section.
- Colour is used to group and structure items on the page i.e Resources and Webinar section.
- There are no broken links.
- Page content is in language the user will understand.  
### Form:
- Only necessary questions are on the form.
- Fields are labelled conventionally.
- Form submission is confirmed by a confirmation page, in this case the Code Institute page showing that the information has been inputted to the site, but in future a confirmation page will be implemented.
- The user is given direction on what is needed to fill in the form correctly I.e required fields, no of characters, inclusion of '@'.
- Email field contains an example to make the expected input clear.  


## The Confirmation Page <a name="confirmation"></a>
This page is displayed when the user registers for the webinar, it confirms to the user that they have their place confirmed in the webinar. It gives them a compact information panel with time and date details with an image showing the date of the Webinar in pictorial form. It also displays a pictorial representation of the Zoom logo, and a message that the link will be delivered to them via email.
There is also a final message to the user on  why it is a good idea to connect with social media as there will be additional information and resources available within these channels. This also acts as a CTA to engage in these channels.  

#### User Experience Checklist for Confirmation Page

- The layout focuses the user's attention on the essential details needed for the webinar I.e. The date and time and the location.
- The images reinforce the details in the information panels. Making use of skeuomorphism by using objects i.e. Zoom Logo and Scheduling Icons, concepts easily recognized by users. 
-The background is uncomplicated so necessary information is easily found.
-The user is informed on what the next steps will be in relation to the webinar.
-There is a clear call to action as the user is encouraged to connect on social media channels to avail of further information and resources.  


## The 404 Page  <a name="404"></a>
This page is displayed to the user if they experience a problem connecting with a desired link. In accordance with the general theme of the site, it conveys a serene image, with an accompanying message in the spirit of relaxation.  I believe the image conveys the spirit of relaxation and although not normally done I left the elements of the website in place in order for the user to return to the website on whatever page they require.  

#### User Experience Checklist for 404 Page

- The image is in keeping with the concept of the website.
- All page content is useful and appropriate for the situation.

## Features to be implemented in the Future <a name="future"></a>
- As mentioned previously, there were a couple of challenges with existing features that I would like to improve in the future. I will utilize javascript to redirect users to the thank you page after they submit their details for the webinar. 
- I will also insert the call to action for the newsletter sign up, and use javascript to create a pop-up form and a notification when they have sucessfully signed up.
- In relation to forms I would also use a captcha/anti-spam feature for security reasons.
- At the moment the navigation on small screens seems adequate, but if I was to add more menu items I would have to implement a hamburger menu.
- I would like to introduce more interactivity in the site by use of a blog, with the latest blog being highlighted within the site and enable users to comment and form threads to promote connections.

### Content of the site
I created the written content but drew inspiration from this:
[Better up.com Blog](https://www.betterup.com/blog/mind-body-and-soul?fbclid=IwAR3YrY5lJSkBwhZ5ThmwbzLNSRhWmvyO2dHpYe2XXrltwZ-tI8QgQrWUlWo)
I have had an interest in holistic health and stress management in the past and feel Work/Life Balance is a topic highly relevant in the current climate.  

### Media
All the imagery from the site was obtained from:
Pixalbay Pexels, Unsplash
The video was sourced from YouTube.

### Code
The Social Media code was based on the code in 'Cool Runnings' project, the previous website on the Code Institute Course.
