          <p>Life can be busy, whether you are a Student, a Worker, a stay at home Mum or a human of
            any variety. It can be hard to get the balance right between work and play. How do we turn
            off and experience life without worrying about our next crisis. It's important to step back
            and evaluate what we are doing right and what could be better. This website attempts to offer
            ways that you can try new practises that give you a chance to stop and breathe. They may inspire
            you to find your own coping strategies, but you never know what can make the difference, just
            open your mind and step into a new way of living, it will make living a whole lot easier for
            yourself and the people around you.
